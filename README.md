# ideas

 - print currently playing song from metadata
 - press a key to note the artist/title/album/other metadada
 - integrate to some album metadata site, search for this to find album details
 - somehow integrate with nicotine/soulseek, but this can get messy and probably needs manual intervention
 - log artists/titles/albums/other metadata, make available for some kind of analytics
 - could actually go connect to every station in a given country and log these over time to show what the country is listening to as a whole (or per region etc)
 - can we identify... radio station owners?
 - prevalence of clearchannel/whatever in africa, vs. independent/state owned broadcasters. how does music get distributed? this will affect our outputs
 - auto-finding of the *real* streaming links... i have to use dev tools for this rn. not sure how we would do this but it's an interesting idea.
 - note that for example radio.garden and other sites seem to wrap the real streams in something that serves localized ads in the audio stream. this is what i want to avoid.
